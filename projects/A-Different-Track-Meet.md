Track and field is a sport that includes athletic contests established on running, jumping, and throwing. In my senior year of high school, a track team from my old middle school lost their coach. This caused them to miss out on the chances to register for track meets, causing all of their hours to spend at practice to go to waste. I felt terrible for them; having been on track for all four years of high school and most of the middle school, I could relate to the disappointment they must have felt not to be able to compete. As the captain of my school track team, I talked it over with my coach, and we decided to hold a track meet for them at our brand new field. They were pleased to learn that they could finally race in an actual match, so they agreed, and we had a mini track meet.

We had events that were just like a regular track meet, like the relay and the long-distance events. However, there were no field events because the middle schoolers did not practice for it. For most of the meet, the middle schooler just raced each other, and we would cheer them on. But there was one particular event where we had a mixed relay where our team would combine with their team, and we would race. This was the only way we could have a fair event between the high schoolers and middle schoolers. It ended up being a lot of fun, and it brought out our competitive side. The day before the meet, I had prepared ribbons for them just like a real track meet. I would print out their names and laminate it so that it looks very official. And then, I would hot glue black and gold ribbons around the circle. I am very proud of the end to result in both the ribbons and the track meet. The next year they found a new coach and were able to do actual meets. I am glad I was able to do something for my old track team and help them through a tough time.
