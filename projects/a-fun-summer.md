[Summer fun](http://www.honolulu.gov/parks/program/summer-fun-program.html) is a program that includes a wide variety of free and paid activities ranging from learning to swim to sports, arts and crafts, music, and dance. During one of my summer breaks, I volunteered as a junior leader at the McCully Summer Fun program. Throughout the program, I worked under the supervision of a summer aid to supervise and teach the classes and activities they offered. One of the things I did was hold a class where I teach the kids finger knitting. I would stand up in front of them and show them how to do the knitting, and then I would have them do it and assist them if they needed it. 

I was in charge of the sixth-grader as I was one of the oldest junior leaders. I felt that it was more challenging to handle the older kids because they tend to rebel more. At first, I was very frustrated that they would not listen to me at all. Suppose my supervisor tells me to lead them in something they would often do their things and only listen when the supervisor asks. However, as the summer progressed, I started to learn more about their personal stories and what makes them behave the way they do. For example, one of the kids that rebel does not have a happy home life. With this thought in mind, I could understand why they act the way they do, and it made it easier for me to handle them. The program helped me learn that you should try to understand both sides of the story before making decisions. 

Aside from the things we do with kids in the morning, the junior leaders also have a program of their own after the kid's program ends. We would do fun activities with each other as well as junior leaders from other Summer Fun programs. One main thing that we do weekly is hold a dodgeball gameâ€”we would have tournaments where each week we play with different Summer Fun groups. At the end of the summer, the junior leader had a fun day at Wet and Wild, where we could relax and have fun with each other. Unfortunately, the year I found out about this program, I was 17, so I could not come back another year, but I most definitely would if I could.
