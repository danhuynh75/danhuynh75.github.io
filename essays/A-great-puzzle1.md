	Puzzles are a lot of fun. For one, it is satisfying when you find pieces that fit perfectly with each other. And when you finish it, you get to see the fruit of your work in the form of an aesthetically pleasing picture and feel proud. That accomplished feeling is the same feeling I get whenever I see my code come out the exact way I want it. 
	Learning and using UI framework has been the most fun I have had in my ICS courses. Usually, when coding often the outcome is more code, or sometimes nothing at all. This can make coding boring, leading to frustrations and loss of interest in the subject. However, when I make a website, I can see the work I did and get the same feeling I get whenever I finish a puzzle. 
	Although UI frameworks are not simple and could be considered as difficult as learning a new language, I do not mind. I prefer it over using raw HTML and CSS because it provides better options to make my website look better. In fact, I do not find it hard at all because I enjoy learning it. I might have just found my career path in learning about semantic UI.
