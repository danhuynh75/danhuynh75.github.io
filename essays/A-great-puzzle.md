Puzzles are a lot of fun. For one, it is satisfying when you find pieces that fit perfectly with each other. And when you finish it, you get to see the fruit of your work in the form of an aesthetically pleasing picture and feel proud, especially if that puzzle took me the longest time to finish. That accomplished feeling is the same feeling I get whenever I see my code come out the exact way I want it.  Those moments are the only reason I was able to last this long in computer science. 

Learning and using UI framework has been the most fun I have had in my ICS courses. Usually, when coding often the outcome is more code, or sometimes nothing at all. This can make coding boring, leading to frustrations and loss of interest in the subject. Not to mention if you cannot see what has made it is hard to fix bugs. There were so many times I wanted to rip my hair out because I was frustrated over a code. However, when I make a website, I can see the work I did and see maybe I forgot to change the color of a menu or my columns are not aligned because I forgot to put " class = 'column' " at the beginning. Not to mention the excitement and satisfaction I get whenever I finish a website; it is the same feeling as when I finish a great puzzle.

Although UI frameworks are not simple and could be considered as difficult as learning a new language, I do not mind. I prefer it over using raw HTML and CSS because it provides better options to make my website look better. In fact, I do not find it hard at all because I have a fun time learning it. After all, if you enjoy your work, it is not working at all. I might have just discovered my career path in learning about semantic UI.
