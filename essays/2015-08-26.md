Java is an object-oriented program that is easy to learn. Java is the default choice for scientific applications mainly. This is because it is safe, portable, maintainable, and comes with better high-level concurrency tools than C++ or any other language. Another reason for Java's popularity is its strong and active community support. It the second-largest among the Stack Overflow community. So help is there whenever you caught a nasty bug in your program. As a student who did a lot of Java coding, this is a beneficial thing to have. 

Just as popular as Java is the programming language python. Python is easy to use, powerful, and versatile, making it an excellent choice for beginners and experts. Python has regular English syntax, so you can have an easier time reading and writing code without having to worry about missing a small detail. Compared to Java and C++, python requires less time, effort, and code lines to perform the same operations. It is used by many large companies such as Google, Dropbox, Spotify, and Netflix.

With all these fantastic languages you can learn to write codes with, each with a different style learning about the software can be so much fun. I am excited to learn all these other languages and use them to code programs that I could use daily. Software engineering is a great thing because of all the technologies and programs that we run on it and its bits of help in relieving us from specific daily tasks that might be too much. I cannot wait till the day I can create my own games or write a simple code that will add my homework deadlines onto my calendar.
