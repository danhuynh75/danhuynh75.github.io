Java and Javascript is the only programming language that I have been exposed to in my previous classes. Before this class, I had never code with Javascript, and to be honest, I did not know that Java and Javascript are two different things. Contrary to Javascript, I have been coding with Java for my ICS 111 and 211 class, so I am slightly more familiar with it. The syntax between the two languages is similar, judging from all the classwork, FreeCampCode, and the WOD we have done. The one big difference I have noticed is that you can still run the program in Javascript if you miss a semicolon. Another syntax I have seen is the triple equal sign, which Javascript has that Java does not have. 

So far, I have not had a tough time with the work. All the codes we have written are reasonably easy to understand and write. I have not run into a bug that I could not fix yet. I believe I have my knowledge in Java that helped me in Javascript. I have been enjoying all the work we did in class so far. However, I do struggle with the time limits that we have for the WOD. I still have to get used to writing functional codes quickly, and I look forward to improving this aspect.

The professor once said that by the end of this class, we would have the ability to write a code that will do something to the calendar; I do not remember the specifics. So far, in all of my ICS classes, we have been doing codes on random things that we cannot use in our daily life. As fun as writing and debugging codes have been, I think it would be even more enjoyable to write a useful code for me. By the end of this class, I hope that I could write a simple code that will be helpful outside of just submitting and getting a grade.
